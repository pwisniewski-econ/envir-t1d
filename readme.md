# 🌍 Ecological Modeling of Type 1 Diabetes in Metropolitan France

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains the full analytical pipeline of a project developed for the **Business Data Challenge 2025** at ENSAE Paris.  
The goal is to identify and quantify **environmental, social, and economic factors** associated with the incidence of **Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)** among young individuals in metropolitan France.

We combine **individual-level hospital data** from the French PMSI system with rich external datasets (pollution, weather, nutrition, socio-demographics, infrastructure), and apply causal inference techniques to analyze risk and protective factors.

> ✅ **Note on modeling scripts**:  
> - Scripts `23-A-poisson-CASD.R` and `24-A-fixed_poisson-CASD.R` were executed in **R** within the **CASD environment** to produce the official results used in the report.  
> - Their corresponding `.py` versions are faithful **Python transcriptions**, included for documentation, readability, and reproducibility.  
> - The Double Machine Learning model (`25-double_ml-CASD.R`) was developed **exclusively in R**, as the estimation is too complex and unstable in Python, leading to unreliable inference.

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1. Poisson & Negative Binomial Regressions (R/Python)
- Aggregated data at **arrondissement** and **BV2022** levels
- Predictors: air quality, nutrition, water quality, public infrastructure, socio-demographics (via PCA)
- Models estimated using **Poisson GLM** and **Negative Binomial**

### 2. Fixed Effects Poisson Model (R/Python)
- Monthly incidence data at **department** level
- Investigates the **sunlight–vitamin D hypothesis**
- Controls for unobserved heterogeneity with department fixed effects

### 3. Double Machine Learning (R only)
- Partial effect estimation of selected "treatments" (e.g. tobacco use, pollution)
- Implements **DoubleMLPLR** with **Random Forests**
- Computational complexity and interpretability considerations led to using only the R implementation

## 📈 Key Results

| Variable / Factor               | Effect on T1D | Notes |
|--------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| 🌞 Sunlight exposure            | ⬇ -3.8%/day   | Strong evidence from fixed effects models |
| 🚬 Tobacco addiction (Males)   | ⬆            | Significant and robust across models |
| 🥗 Vitamin D deficiency         | ⬆            | Consistent with theory and sunlight findings |
| 🍔 Fast-food access             | ⬆            | Moderately significant in DML |
| 🧂 Calcium deficiency           | ⬆            | Observed in Poisson and NB |
| 🛑 Assaults (proxy for stress)  | ⬆            | Stronger in females |
| 🌫️ NO₂ concentration           | ⬇ (weak)     | Lost significance under DML |

## 🔁 How to Reproduce (Python version)

> ⚠️ Due to confidentiality rules, **PMSI hospital data is not shared publicly**. Scripts below assume access.

1. Set up Python environment:
```bash
conda create -n dt1-env python=3.10
conda activate dt1-env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run scripts:
```bash
# Data cleaning & preparation
python scripts/01-B-table_insee.py
...

# Optional model replication in Python
python src/23-A-poisson-CASD.py
python src/24-A-fixed_poisson-CASD.py
```

3. Run modeling in R (preferred / official results):
```r
# Main causal models
source("src/23-A-poisson-CASD.R")
source("src/24-A-fixed_poisson-CASD.R")
source("src/25-double_ml-CASD.R")
```
