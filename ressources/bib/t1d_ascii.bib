            {RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}This investigation was based on a nationwide study (Diabetes Incidence Study in Sweden) of newly diagnosed patients aged 1534 years. Patients clinically classified as type 1 diabetic with antibodies to islet cells and/or to {GAD}65 were compared with age- and sex-matched control subjects via questionnaire. The questionnaire covered diabetes heredity, social environment, educational level, and life events experienced during the 12 months before diagnosis.
            {RESULTS}The rate of response was 82\% for the diabetic patients and 65\% for the control subjects. Questionnaires from 349 diabetic patients and 979 control subjects were considered. Diabetes in relatives was more frequent in the patients (odds ratio [{OR}]2.6) who were born in Sweden and whose mothers were of Swedish origin. No major stress factors were detected in the diabetic patients; however, in comparison with the control subjects, the diabetic patients had experienced fewer conflicts with their parents and had less often broken contacts with friends.
            {CONCLUSIONS}Young adults with recent-onset type 1 diabetes were more exposed to heredity for diabetes, but no major prediabetic stress factors were detected. Our study does not directly support the concept that psychosocial stressful life events are involved in the development of autoimmune type 1 diabetes in young adults.},

            {RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}We conducted an incident population-based case-referent study in Stockholm, Sweden, including 99 of 100 eligible 7- to 14-year-old diabetic children and 180 of 200 age-, sex-, and area-matched referent children identified through the Swedish population register. Average daily energy and nutrient intake 1 year before diabetes diagnosis/interview was estimated using the food frequency questionnaire with assessment of consumed food amounts. Mean {SD} scores of growth measurements taken during the last 4 years before the diagnosis were used. Odds ratios ({ORs}) were calculated by conditional logistic regression.
            {RESULTS}Average intake of energy, carbohydrate, fat, and protein was significantly higher among the case subjects as well as mean weight-for-age {SD} score. Higher energy intake and weight-for-age were both associated with increased diabetes risk after adjustment for each other: {OR} (95\% {CI}) for medium and high levels of energy intake were 1.33 (0.523.42) and 5.23 (1.6716.38), respectively, and for weight-for-age were 3.20 (1.307.88) and 3.09 (1.168.22), respectively. High intake of carbohydrates, especially disaccharides and sucrose, increased diabetes risk.
            {CONCLUSIONS} Higher energy intake and larger body size were independently associated with increased diabetes risk. Of the different nutrients, higher intake of carbohydrates, particularly disaccharides and sucrose, increased the risk. Lifestyle habits leading to higher energy intake and more rapid growth in childhood may contribute to the increase of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes by different mechanisms.},

              Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common autoimmune disease that is characterized by insufficient insulin production. The onset of T1D is the result of gene-environment interactions. Sociodemographic and behavioural factors may contribute to T1D, and the gut microbiota is proposed to be a driving factor of T1D. An integrated preventive strategy for T1D is not available at present. This casecontrol study attempted to estimate the exposure linked to T1D to identify significant risk factors for healthy children. Forty children with T1D and 56 healthy controls were included in this study. Anthropometric, socio-economic, nutritional, behavioural, and clinical data were collected. Faecal bacteria were investigated by molecular methods. The findings showed, in multivariable model, that the risk factors for T1D include higher Firmicutes levels ({OR} 7.30; {IC} 2.2623.54) and higher carbohydrate intake ({OR} 1.03; {IC} 1.011.05), whereas having a greater amount of
              Bifidobacterium
              in the gut ({OR} 0.13; {IC} 0.05  0.34) was a protective factor for T1D. These findings may facilitate the development of preventive strategies for T1D, such as performing genetic screening, characterizing the gut microbiota, and managing nutritional and social factors.},

              Results
              
                A total of 449 and 99 men developed impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance during 3,403 and 4,092 personyears follow up, respectively. The multivariableadjusted hazard ratios (
                {HR}

              Aims
              An increased risk for Type 2 diabetes in male and female smokers has been associated with insulin resistance. However, this might also be the result of an adverse effect on the cell. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between smoking and cell function.
            
            
              Methods
              A communitybased, crosssectional observation study. In 1994, a randomized agestratified sample of men and women aged 40years in the city of Skara, Sweden, were invited to a survey of cardiovascular risk factors. In all, 1109 subjects participated (80\%). After the exclusion of subjects with known hypertension or diabetes mellitus, 874 subjects remained to explore. Samples were drawn after an overnight fast. Lifestyle (smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption) was assessed using a questionnaire. Insulin resistance and insulin secretion were estimated using the homeostasis model assessment ({HOMA}).
            
            
              Results
              Cigarette smoking men (
              n
              =101) had a lower {HOMA} cell value (58.1), than neversmokers (
              n
              =158, cell value 90.1,
              P
              {\textless}0.001). The difference remained with adjustments for age, body mass index, daily alcohol intake and physical exercise habits: 25.9 (95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 9.738.8,
              P
              =0.003). Correspondingly, in men the {HOMA} cell value was lower in current smokers than in exsmokers (difference 24.3, 95\% {CI} 11.135.2,
              P
              {\textless}0.001). In women, no significant difference appeared in cell function vs. different smoking status. There was no association between smoking status and insulin resistance.
            
            
              Conclusions
              At least in men, smoking may interfere with cell function. The prevention of Type 2 diabetes should include strategies to stop smoking.},

	abstract = {The increase in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) incidence in children is worrying and not yet fully explored. It is suggested that probably air pollution exposure could contribute to the development of T1DM. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between the concentration of gaseous pollutants including, nitrogen dioxide ({NO}
              2
              ), nitric oxides ({NOx}), sulphur dioxide ({SO}
              2
              ), carbon monoxide ({CO}), and particulate matter ({PM}) in the air, and the number of new cases of T1DM in children. The number of new cases of T1DM was obtained from the Clinic of Paediatrics, Diabetology, and Endocrinology, Medical University of Gdask. The number of children of 018 years old in Pomeranian Voivodeship was acquired from the Statistical Yearbook. The concentrations of {PM}

              , {NOx}, {SO}
              2
              , and {CO} were measured at 41 measuring posts, between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2016. It was detected that the average annual concentration of {PM}
              10
              was higher than the value acceptable to the {WHO}. Furthermore, the average 24hour concentration of {PM}
              10
              was 92

              g/m
              3
              (acc. to {EU} and {WHO}). Moreover, the number of new cases of T1DM showed a correlation with the annual average concentration of {PM}
              10
              (
              
              =2.396,

              p
              {\textless} 0.001), and {CO} (
              
              =2.452,
              p
              {\textless} 0.001). High exposure to gaseous pollutants and particulate matter in ambient air may be one of the factors contributing to the risk of developing T1DM in children. Therefore, it is important to take action to decrease air pollutant emissions in Poland. It is crucial to gradually but consistently eliminate the use of solid fuels, such as coal and wood in households, in favour of natural gas and electricity. The development of new technologies to improve air quality, such as best available techniques ({BAT}) or renewable energy sources (water, wind, and solar generation) is of critical importance as well.},
